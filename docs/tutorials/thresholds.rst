Thresholds
==========

NannyML calculators and estimators allow a user to configure alerting thresholds for more fine-grained control
over the alerts generated by NannyML.

This tutorial will walk you through threshold basics and how to use them to customize the behavior of NannyML.

Just the code
=============

.. nbimport::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cells: 1 7 8 9 10 11 12

Walkthrough
===========

We'll use an F1-score estimation as an example use case.
But first, let's dive into some of the basics. Note that we're explaining how the thresholds work in the internals of
NannyML. How you'll be using them is shown further down this page.

NannyML compares the metric values it calculates to lower and upper threshold values. If the metric values fall
outside of the range determined by these, NannyML will flag these values as alerts.

NannyML provides simple classes to customize this behavior.

Constant thresholds
-------------------

The :class:`~nannyml.thresholds.ConstantThreshold` class is a very basic threshold. It is given a lower and upper value
when initialized and these will be returned as the lower and upper threshold values, independent of what reference data
is passed to it.

The :class:`~nannyml.thresholds.ConstantThreshold` can be configured using the following parameters:

- ``lower``: an optional float that sets the constant lower value. Defaults to ``None``.
                            Setting this to ``None`` disables the lower threshold.
- ``upper``: an optional float that sets the constant upper threshold value. Defaults to ``None``.
                            Setting this to ``None`` disables the upper threshold.

This snippet shows how to create an instance of the :class:`~nannyml.thresholds.ConstantThreshold`:

.. nbimport::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cells: 2
    :show_output:


Standard deviation thresholds
-----------------------------

The :class:`~nannyml.thresholds.StandardDeviationThreshold` class will use the mean of the data it is given as
a baseline. It will then add the standard deviation of the given data, scaled by a multiplier, to that baseline to
calculate the upper threshold value. By subtracting the standard deviation, scaled by a multiplier, from the baseline
it calculates the lower threshold value.

The :class:`~nannyml.thresholds.StandardDeviationThreshold` can be configured using the following parameters:

- ``std_lower_multiplier``: an optional float that scales the offset for the lower threshold value. Defaults to ``3``.
                            Setting this to ``None`` disables the lower threshold.
- ``std_upper_multiplier``: an optional float that scales the offset for the upper threshold value. Defaults to ``3``.
                            Setting this to ``None`` disables the upper threshold.
- ``offset_from``: a function used to aggregate the given data.

This snippet shows how to create an instance of the :class:`~nannyml.thresholds.StandardDeviationThreshold`:

.. nbimport::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cells: 3
    :show_output:


Setting custom thresholds for calculators and estimators
---------------------------------------------------------

All calculators and estimators in NannyML support custom thresholds. You can specify a custom threshold for each
drift detection method and performance metric.

.. warning::

    The :math:`chi^2` drift detection method for categorical data does not support custom thresholds yet.
    It is currently using p-values for thresholding and replacing them by or incorporating them in the custom
    thresholding system requires further research.

    For now it will continue to function as it did before.

    When specifying a custom threshold for :math:`chi^2` in the
    :class:`~nannyml.drift.univariate.calculator.UnivariateDriftCalculator`, NannyML will log a warning message
    to clarify the custom threshold will be ignored.

We'll illustrate this by means of performance estimation using `CBPE`.
First we load our datasets.

.. nbimport::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cells: 4

.. nbtable::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cell: 5

Next we'll set up the CBPE estimator. Note that we're not providing any threshold specifications for now.
Let's check out the defaults:

.. nbimport::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cells: 6
    :show_output:

After running the estimation we can see some alerts popping up. This means a couple of threshold values have been breached.

.. nbimport::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cells: 7

.. nbtable::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cell: 8

The plots clearly illustrate this:

.. nbimport::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cells: 9

.. image:: ../_static/tutorials/thresholds/est_f1_default_thresholds.svg

Now let's set a threshold that inverses this result by fixing the upper threshold and dropping the lower.

.. nbimport::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cells: 11
    :show_output:

Let's use this new custom threshold for our performance estimation now.
Note that we're passing our custom thresholds as a dictionary,
mapping the metric name to a :class:`~nannyml.thresholds.Threshold` instance.
We only have to provide our single override value, the other metrics will use the default values.

.. nbimport::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cells: 12

.. nbtable::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cell: 13

If we check the plots, we can see that the alerts have now inverted.

.. nbimport::
    :path: ./example_notebooks/Tutorial - Thresholds.ipynb
    :cells: 14

.. image:: ../_static/tutorials/thresholds/est_f1_inverted_thresholds.svg


Default thresholds
-------------------

Performance metrics and drift detection methods have the following default threshold:

.. code-block:: python

    StandardDeviationThreshold(std_lower_multiplier=3, std_upper_multiplier=3, offset_from=np.mean)


Some drift detection methods are exceptions to this rule. They have default thresholds more attuned to distances:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25, 25, 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Calculator
     - Drift method
     - Default threshold
   * - Univariate drift calculator
     - `jensen_shannon`
     - ``ConstantThreshold(upper=0.1)``
   * - Univariate drift calculator
     - `hellinger`
     - ``ConstantThreshold(upper=0.1)``
   * - Univariate drift calculator
     - `l_infinity`
     - ``ConstantThreshold(upper=0.1)``
